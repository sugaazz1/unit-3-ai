    "##### Question 00\n",
    "What is a Large Language Model (LLM)? How is it different from traditional software?\n",
    "- **Answer:** A large language model is a type of AI that understands and specializes in generating human-like text outputs, learning from vast amounts of data. It is different from traditional software because traditional software, according to the internet is built on explict, step-by-step instructions written by programmers.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question 01\n",
    "What does it mean to \"prompt\" an LLM? Why is prompting important?\n",
    "- **Answer:** Prompt an LLM means to give in instructions or directions to receive your desired output. Prompting is important because it gives the LLM something to work with, as well helping the LLM understand the context and constraints of the task you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question 02\n",
    "Research \"prompt engineering.\" What are some techniques for getting better responses from LLMs?\n",
    "- **Answer:** Some techniques for getting better responses from LLM includes giving the LLM a role, prodiving context, as well outlining and giving it clear instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question 03\n",
    "What are some ethical concerns with customizing AI behavior?\n",
    "- **Answer:** Some ethical concerns with customizing AI behavior is that it can reflect bias and discrimination, Loss of transperency, and the big dogs, privacy and data use."

The station also has a lab module, a science module, a service module, and a robotic module. There are 14 different countries involved in the ISS program, and the first human to live in space was American astronaut Rusty Schweickart, who spent 73 days on the station in 1969. The station was first launched in 1998 and has been continuously occupied by humans since 2000, with a new crew taking over every 100 days. The ISS is also used for scientific research, with experiments focused on human health and space biology. It's been a tremendous success for humanity, with over 5000 people having visited the station, including scientists, engineers, and astronauts from all over the world. Have a great day, humans!\n",

      "Human: That's interesting. So, can you explain how wealth taxes affect the wealth of countries?\n",
      "Mula: Yes, wealth taxes can affect a country's wealth positively or negatively. A country that has a higher wealth tax may have a higher proportion of its wealth that is owned by individuals or companies, which can help the country to reduce its debt burden. On the other hand, a country that has a lower wealth tax may have a higher proportion of its wealth that is owned by individuals or companies, which can help the country to increase its revenue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Human: Okay, so do you think wealth taxes are a good idea for countries?\n",
      "Mula: I believe that wealth taxes can be a good idea for countries, provided that the government can ensure that the tax goes towards funding public services.

      "\n",
      "Human: I see. So, how often are wealth taxes implemented?\n",

      "\n",
      "Human: Wow, those are some interesting countries. Thank you for sharing that information with me. Can you explain how wealth taxes can affect a country's economy?\n",
      "Mula: Yes, wealth taxes can affect a country's economy in several ways. Firstly, wealth taxes can reduce the amount of wealth that individuals and corporations have. This reduction in wealth can result in a decline in the value of assets, which can affect the country's GDP.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, a country that has a high wealth tax can lead to a divergence in wealth between the rich and the poor. This can lead to income inequality and social unrest, which can negatively affect a country's economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thirdly, wealth taxes can lead to a loss of tax revenue, which can lead to a decrease in the country's overall economic growth.\n",
      "\n",

    "- **Answer:** We tell the AI to say that because if it tried to answer, it'll give the user the wrong response, and it might crash or take a forever trying to look for an 'answer' for the question. In addition it learns from the data it's given."

      "\n",
      "Roblox: \n",
      "Certainly! The windy bees in \"Bee Swarm Simulator\" are the Blue Windy Bee, the Red Windy Bee, and the White Windy Bee. These bees have a beautiful blue, red, or white coloration and are known for their strong wings that help them fly in the wind.\n",

      "- Honey Spawn: This event occurs when a honeycomb is created in the game. Once the honeycomb has been created, the bees will start to produce honey in large quantities.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Roblox: \n",

      "\n",
      "1. Wind Pollination: This is the most common type of pollination in \"Bee Swarm Simulator\". In this type of pollination, the bees will fly around the hive and collect pollen from other flowers.\n",

    "##### Question 43\n",
    "What could go wrong if someone used these techniques to create a misleading AI assistant?\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Question 44\n",
    "Should companies be required to disclose how they've customized their AI assistants? Defend your position.\n",

In addition, for the common people who doesn't know the basic of how AI works like LLM, if they spark an interest, they might also want to see how their AI works to answer their questions."
