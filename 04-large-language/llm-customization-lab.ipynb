    "##### Question 00\n",
    "What is a Large Language Model (LLM)? How is it different from traditional software?\n",
    "- **Answer:** A large language model is a type of AI that understands and specializes in generating human-like text outputs, learning from vast amounts of data. It is different from traditional software because traditional software, according to the internet is built on explict, step-by-step instructions written by programmers.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question 01\n",
    "What does it mean to \"prompt\" an LLM? Why is prompting important?\n",
    "- **Answer:** Prompt an LLM means to give in instructions or directions to receive your desired output. Prompting is important because it gives the LLM something to work with, as well helping the LLM understand the context and constraints of the task you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question 02\n",
    "Research \"prompt engineering.\" What are some techniques for getting better responses from LLMs?\n",
    "- **Answer:** Some techniques for getting better responses from LLM includes giving the LLM a role, prodiving context, as well outlining and giving it clear instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question 03\n",
    "What are some ethical concerns with customizing AI behavior?\n",
    "- **Answer:** Some ethical concerns with customizing AI behavior is that it can reflect bias and discrimination, Loss of transperency, and the big dogs, privacy and data use."
