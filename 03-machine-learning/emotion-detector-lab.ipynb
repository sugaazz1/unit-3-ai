    "What is machine learning, and how is it different from traditional programming?\n",
    "- **Answer:** Machine learning is a department in AI that creates algorithms that allows AI to learn and improve on their own, without much of human assistance. It is different from tradtional programming as machine learning learns from it's data and create its own rule.\n",

    "##### Question 01\n",
    "What is a neural network? Why do you think it's called \"neural\"?\n",
    "- **Answer:** A neural network is a type of machine learning inspired by the brain. It's the part that handles complex decision making and patterns to output the perfect result. It's called neural because it's inspired by the brains neural network.\n",
